                        Pablo Picasso was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and stage
                        designer considered one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th
                        century. Picasso is credited, along with Georges Braque, with the creation of Cubism.

    <p class="Title"> Blue Period </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            The Picasso art period known as the Blue Period extended from 1901 to 1904. During this time,
            the artist painted primarily in shades of blue, with occasional touches of accent color.
            Historians attribute Picasso's Blue Period largely to the artist's apparent depression following a friend's
            suicide. Some of the recurring subjects in the Blue Period are blindness, poverty and the female nude.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> Rose Period </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            The Rose Period lasted from 1904 through 1906. Shades of pink and rose imbued Picasso's art with a warmer,
            less melancholy air than his Blue Period paintings. Harlequins, clowns and circus folk are among
            therecurring
            subjects in these artworks. Elements of primitivism in the Rose Period paintings reflect experimentation
            with
            the Picasso art style.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> African Influence </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            During his African art and Primitivism period from 1907 to 1909. Inspired by the angular African
            art he viewed in an exhibit at the Palais de Trocadero and by an African mask owned by Henri Matisse,
            Picasso's art reflected these influences during this period. Ironically, Matisse was among the most
            vocal denouncers of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" when Picasso first showed it to his inner circle.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> Synthetic Cubism </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            This era of Picasso's life extended from 1912 to 1919. Picasso's works continued in the Cubist vein,
            but the artist introduced a new art form, collage, into some of his creations. He also incorporated
            the human form into many Cubist paintings. Although a number of artists he knew left Paris to fight
            in World War I, Picasso spent the war years in his studio.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> Neoclassicism and Surrealism </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            The Picasso art period extending from 1919 to 1929 featured a significant shift in style. In the wake
            of his first visit to Italy and the conclusion of World War I, the artist's paintings reflected a
            restoration of order in art, and his neoclassical artworks offer a stark contrast to his Cubist paintings.
            However, as the French Surrealist Movement gained traction in the mid-1920s, Picasso began to reprise his
            penchant for Primitivism in such Surrealist-influenced paintings. During the 1930s, Picasso's works such
            as his well-known Guernica, a unique depiction of the Spanish Civil War, reflected the violence of war time.
            The menacing minotaur became a central symbol of his art, replacing the harlequin of his earlier years.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> 1940 - 1973 </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            During World War II, Picasso remained in Paris under German occupation, enduring Gestapo harassment while
            he continued to create art. Some of the time, he wrote poetry, completing more than 300 works between 1939
            and 1959. He also completed two plays, "Desire Caught by the Tail," and "The Four Little Girls."
            As his life neared its end, the artist experienced a flurry of creativity. The resulting artworks were a
            mixture of his previous styles and included colorful paintings and copper etchings. Art experts later
            recognized the beginnings of Neo-Expressionism in Picasso's final works.
