                        The painter María Blanchard, whose real name was María Gutiérrez Cueto, was a Spanish painter,
                        best known for her paintings in the Cubist style. María chose to use the surname of her
                        grandmother,
                        Blanchard.

    <p class="Title"> Early Life </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            María's mother had an accident during her pregnancy that meant María was born with severe disabilities
            such as a deformation of the spine. As a result, María Blanchard had a hunchback and found it very difficult
            to walk. She was teased heavily at school which left her with many emotional scars. However María Blanchard
            found her painting to be a great way of escaping her troubles and expressing how she felt. In 1903, María
            Blanchard moved to study in Madrid where she began training with Spanish artists such as Emilio Sala and
            Manuel Benedito. With Emilio Sala, María learnt the precision of his drawing and the exuberant use of
            colour.
            These elements would feature in some of her first compositions.
        </p>

    <p class="Title"> Mature Period </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            After winning the third prize for one of her paintings at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, María
            Blanchard's local government of Santander decided to fund her education in the arts with a grant in 1909.
            With the aid
            of this grant, Blanchard went to study in Paris at the Vitti Academy. While at the Academy, she received
            artistic training
            from such great figures as Kees van Dongen and Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa. It was also at this academy
            that María
            Blanchard would discover Cubism and be influenced by artists like Juan Gris.
        </p>

    <p class="Title"> Style evolution </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            In Paris, María Blanchard began spending time with the many Cubist artists living there, and she was
            particularly good friends with the Cubist Spanish painter, Juan Gris, whose influence can clearly be
            seen in many of her paintings. She joined the Cubist art group and soon began developing her own style
            of Cubism, involving a rich use of colour and the incorporation of personal elements. </br> </br>
            This original Cubist style would develop over the years, becoming more figurative. The drawings would be
            harsh, and the colours would be bright and would often clash. The images were extremely expressive and
            sometimes, even intimidating.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Title"> Late Period </p>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>
            Juan Gris died in 1927 which had a severe effect on María Blanchard. The loss of this close friendship was
            too much for María to take and so she became a recluse, refusing to see any of her other artist friends.
            However, María continued to paint despite this great personal loss. Unfortunately, her health gradually
            got worse over the coming years, and at one point she contracted tuberculosis which made it impossible
            for her to paint. Eventually, in 1932, María Blanchard died at the age of fifty-one.
